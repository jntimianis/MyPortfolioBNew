          <span className="skillTitle">A Little About Me</span>
          <span className="skillDesc">Throughout my academic journey,
                Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to learn about a wide variety of technologies and topics,
                 which has significantly enhanced my ability to adapt and learn quickly. For example,
                  I took part in a group project where I quickly learned D2L Brightspace and APIs. I was
                   able to apply my new knowledge and significantly improve our project. This experience
                    demonstrates my willingness to learn and my overall capability to grasp new ideas.
                     Through applied projects, I have honed my skills in technologies such as Java, HTML/CSS,
                      SQL, and C#, as well as gaining experience with Agile practices, debugging, technical
                       documentation and software systems design. </span>
