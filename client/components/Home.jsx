                    I'm excited to pursue a career as both a backend 
                    developer and a data analyst because Iâ€™m passionate about harnessing
                    technology to solve complex problems and uncover insights. As a backend
                    developer, I look forward to designing and optimizing systems that power
                    applications and services, ensuring they run smoothly and efficiently.
                    Simultaneously, my interest in data analysis drives me to dive into data
                    sets, uncover meaningful patterns, and support data-driven decision-making.
